Hospital Management System (Salesforce CRM)

The Hospital Management System is a Salesforce CRM-based application designed to streamline and digitize hospital operations. It manages patients, doctors, appointments, admissions, prescriptions, invoices, payments, and lab tests through a centralized platform. The system automates core processes such as appointment scheduling, billing, approvals, and notifications while preventing doctor double-bookings and ensuring data confidentiality with HIPAA/GDPR compliance.

This project was developed in multiple phases. In the requirement gathering phase, the scope was defined to include managing patients, doctors, billing, pharmacy, and lab operations, with security enforced through roles, profiles, and organization-wide defaults. In the development phase, custom Salesforce objects such as Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Admission, Invoice, Payment, Room, Prescription, Medical Record, Lab Test, and Department were created, along with custom fields and relationships. Tabs were configured for all objects, and a dedicated Hospital Management Lightning App was built for easy navigation.

Automation was introduced using validation rules, flows, approval processes, and Apex triggers. For example, validation rules ensure that appointment end times occur after start times and that patient discharge dates occur after admission. Flows were designed to send appointment reminders, payment receipts, and lab result notifications. Approval processes were added for high-cost procedures and insurance claims, while Apex triggers prevented double-booking of doctors. Scheduled Apex jobs were also implemented to send daily appointment reminders.

The user interface was customized with Lightning record pages for Patients, Doctors, Appointments, and Billing. Quick actions such as booking appointments, generating bills, and adding prescriptions were added to the utility bar. Reporting and dashboards were created to provide insights into doctor utilization, department-wise revenue, patient visit history, and unpaid bills. Dynamic dashboards were configured so that each doctor only sees their own data, while administrators and billing managers have broader access.

Security was a major focus of the project. Field-level security and role-based access ensured that sensitive information such as medical history was hidden from unauthorized users, while audit trails were enabled to track changes to critical patient records. The final phase involved delivering an end-to-end demo, where a complete workflow was showcased: booking an appointment, triggering approvals, sending automated notifications, generating billing records, and viewing reports. Documentation in the form of a user guide and technical design document was prepared, and the project was published to LinkedIn and GitHub as part of a professional portfolio.

This project demonstrates practical expertise in Salesforce features including custom objects and fields, validation rules, flows, approval processes, Apex programming, reports, dashboards, data security, and integrations. It highlights the ability to translate real-world healthcare requirements into a robust CRM solution that improves efficiency, enhances patient care, and ensures compliance with data privacy standards.
